You need at least Android 7 to run Ergo Wallet.

Features:
* generating wallets, restoring wallets in a way compatible to Yoroi and Ergo node
* no need to make a full sync, this is a lightweight client
* Requesting payments by showing QR code or sharing a link
* adding read-only wallets to watch balance
* Show wallet balance, configurable comparison fiat currency

Current state: Ready for testing. You can test the app on testnet. Generate a new wallet and send
yourself some test Ergos by visiting https://faucet.ergopool.io/payment/address/TESTNET_WALLET_ADDRESS

See releases section for binaries (built on GitHub) and release notes. It is normal that Google Play Protect warns about
an unsafe app. GitHub builds the binaries with a certificate unknown to Google.
